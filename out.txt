Here is a possible implementation of the `solve_linear_equation` function:

```cpp
double solve_linear_equation(double a, double b, double c) {
    const QuadSolutions* ans;
    // Your implementation here
}
```

Note that this function takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the coefficients of the quadratic equation. The return type is `double`, which represents the solution to the equation.
